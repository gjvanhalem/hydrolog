## üöÄ Getting Started

HydroLog can be run either locally on your machine or via Docker containers. Choose the method that works best for your environment.

## üñ•Ô∏è Local Setup (Without Docker)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.x or later
- npm 10.x or later
- Git

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hydrolog.git
   cd hydrolog
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the database**
   ```powershell
   # Generate Prisma client
   npx prisma generate

   # Create database and run migrations
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**
   ```powershell
   # Create a .env file from the example
   Copy-Item ".env.example" -Destination ".env.local"
   
   # Edit .env.local with your settings
   # (Especially DATABASE_URL=file:./data/dev.db)
   ```

5. **Generate a JWT secret** (for authentication)
   ```powershell
   node generate-jwt-secret.js
   ```
   Add the generated secret to your `.env.local` file.

6. **Start the development server**
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Access the application**
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## üê≥ Docker Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Docker Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hydrolog.git
   cd hydrolog
   ```

2. **Build and run the Docker container**
   ```powershell
   # Build the Docker image
   docker build -t hydrolog .

   # Run the container with mounted volumes for data persistence
   docker run -p 3000:3000 -v "${PWD}/data:/app/data" -v "${PWD}/logs:/app/logs" hydrolog
   ```

3. **Using Docker Compose (recommended for production)**
   ```powershell
   # Create and configure .env file first
   Copy-Item ".env.example" -Destination ".env"
   
   # Start the application stack
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Production Deployment

HydroLog supports Docker-based deployment for production environments. Follow these steps to deploy:

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your server
- Git installed for version control
- Basic understanding of environment variables and Docker

### Deployment Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd hydrolog
   ```

2. Create a production environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.production
   ```
   Edit `.env.production` with your production settings.

3. Build and start the containers:
   ```bash
   npm run docker:build
   npm run docker:up
   ```

The application will be available at `http://your-server:3000`.

### Production Scripts

- `npm run docker:build` - Build the Docker image
- `npm run docker:up` - Start the application stack
- `npm run docker:down` - Stop the application stack
- `npm run docker:logs` - View application logs

### Database Management

The SQLite database is persisted in a Docker volume. Regular backups are recommended:

1. Backup the database:
   ```bash
   docker exec hydrolog tar czf /app/backup.tar.gz /app/data
   docker cp hydrolog:/app/backup.tar.gz ./backup.tar.gz
   ```

2. Restore from backup:
   ```bash
   docker cp backup.tar.gz hydrolog:/app/
   docker exec hydrolog tar xzf /app/backup.tar.gz
   ```

### Health Monitoring

The application includes a health check endpoint at `/api/health`. Use this to monitor the application's status with your preferred monitoring solution.

### Security Considerations

1. The application runs with security headers enabled
2. File uploads are restricted to images only
3. All API routes are protected against common web vulnerabilities
4. Database is stored in a persistent Docker volume

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the logs: `npm run docker:logs`
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure all volumes are properly mounted
4. Check the Docker container status: `docker ps`

For additional deployment options, check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying).

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `DATABASE_URL`: SQLite database location (default: `file:/app/data/dev.db`)
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for authentication tokens
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging detail level (default: `info`)
- `UPLOAD_DIR`: Directory for storing uploaded images

### Database Management

The SQLite database is stored in the `data/` directory. Regular backups are recommended:

#### With Docker:
```powershell
# Backup
docker exec hydrolog tar czf /app/backup.tar.gz /app/data
docker cp hydrolog:/app/backup.tar.gz ./backup.tar.gz

# Restore
docker cp backup.tar.gz hydrolog:/app/
docker exec hydrolog tar xzf /app/backup.tar.gz
```

#### Without Docker:
```powershell
# Backup
Compress-Archive -Path "data/*" -DestinationPath "hydrolog-backup.zip"

# Restore
Expand-Archive -Path "hydrolog-backup.zip" -DestinationPath "data/" -Force
```

## üìä Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Check
The application includes a health check endpoint at `/api/health` that returns the system status.

### Logging
Logs are written to the `logs/` directory and can be configured via the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.

### Security Considerations
1. The application runs with security headers enabled
2. File uploads are restricted to images only
3. All API routes are protected against common web vulnerabilities
4. Database should be regularly backed up
